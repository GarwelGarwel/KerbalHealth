        #KH_Versionmsg1 = Kerbal Health has been updated to v<<1>>. Confinement factor value has been reset to -3. It is recommended that you load each crewed vessel briefly to update Kerbal Health cache.
        #KH_Versionmsg2 = Kerbal Health has been updated to v<<1>>. Radiation settings have been reset. It is recommended that you load each crewed vessel briefly to update Kerbal Health cache.
        #KH_Versionmsg3 = Kerbal Health has been updated to v<<1>>. Solar and Galactic radiation intensities and high-space radiation level adjusted. Stress (formerly Assigned) factor has been reset to -2. Kerbals' training is currently disabled. Please check difficulty settings if you want to enable it and then check every crewed vessel to update Kerbal Health cache.
